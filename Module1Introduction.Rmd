This module will follow the probability section of the textbook. 

This will built on the first 2 courses. 

This will require a basic understanding of statistics. (That sucks)
Many of the problems in the financial and other world result from people not having a strong understanding of probability.  

Timeline:  Try to complete one module per week.  Each module should take around 4 hours.
